### The pain of carrying Pi peripherals.

I had to, on multiple occassions carry a VGA / HD screen alongside a keyboard that can be attached to the Pi. Demos required at the workplace required me to carry the entire working prototype to locations at my work-campus. This started becoming even more cumbersome when the number of discrete electronics on the bread board started piling up. On each of occassions I have had to connect the monitor , keyboard and manually start the program on the Pi and then speak about it.

I kept wishing for a better way to do this. While I knew there had to be a professional way to get around this , just did not know how. What's funnier , I was always aware of upstarting Linux services on `systemd` , I never thought of applying the same.
